                    "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to <b>provide a global vision of 
                    Computer Engineering in both academic and professional points of view</b>. The course gives the students a 
                    grasp of the fundamentals on which this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology 
                    and ethics), the future professional careers and the
                    role of a computer engineer in today's society.
                    <br><br>
                    The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, 
                    while the second helps develop practical skills.
                    <br><br>
                    The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer
                            Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological
                            and ethical foundations.</li>
                        <li>Information and Data: Information representation. 
                            Organization of information.</li>
                        <li>Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in
                            computer systems and applications.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction to 
                    web development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents 
                    related to the course.
                    <br><br>
                    Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development 
                    basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and written, 
                    of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational 
                    project of the University.

        <h3 class = centered>Education activities</h3>
        <div class = textSectionGlass>
            This subject will offer a combination of different activities and methodologies, both in-person (taking place in 
            classrooms and other spaces with the presence of the professor) and non-in-person, have been incorporated.
            <br><br>
            In-person activities have a strong practical component to enhance students' learning. They include:
            <ul>
                <li id= "ulliContent"><b>Theorical classes</b>: The professor will present the fundamental concepts of the subject, encouraging interaction
                    with the students, promoting questions, and facilitating debate on the different topics covered.</li>
                <li id= "ulliContent"><b>Practical classes and laboratory sessions</b>: These sessions will involve the application of concepts learned in
                    class by students to solve exercises and problems. Both individual and group practices will be carried out, and
                    a web projects will be developed.</li>
                <li id= "ulliContent"><b>Work presentations</b>: Students will have the opportunity to present some of the assignments they have
                    completed in the subject.</li>
                <li id= "ulliContent"><b>Workshops</b>: Different workshops will be conducted to develop cross-cutting competencies applied to real
                    cases and projects within the subject area.</li>
                <li id= "ulliContent"><b>Tutorials</b>: Individual or group sessions aimed at clarifying doubts and providing guidance to students</li>
            </ul>
            The required autonomous work will involve both individual and group. This will include the preparation of 
            assignments, reading documentation, studying, and exam preparation. Consistency in autonomous work and 
            keeping up with assignments is highly important.
            <br><br>
            Working groups will be established from the beginning of the subject to encourage collaborative work inside and 
            outside the classroom. Group work will be carried out throughout the semester, with different planned deliverables 
            to provide formative assessment throughout the course. 
            <br><br>
            An online learning platform called the Virtual Classroom will be used to facilitate access to materials, work planning, 
            as well as communication with the professor and other students. This platform offers different electronic resources 
            to complement students learning.
