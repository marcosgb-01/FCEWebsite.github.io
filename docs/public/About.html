                <div class = textSectionGlass>
                    My name is Marcos García Balboa, I am an <b>18 year old first 
                    course computer engineering and business analytics student</b> 
                    in the Francisco de Vitoria university in Madrid.

               <div class = textSectionGlass>
                    I enrolled in this degree to acquire and develop the following
                    skills:
                    <ul>
                        <li id = ulliContent>Programming</li>
                        <li id = ulliContent>Understanding of computers and informatic systems</li>
                        <li id = ulliContent>Problem resolution</li>
                        <li id = ulliContent>Understanding of business and financing</li>
                        <li id = ulliContent>Teamwork and leadership</li>
                        <li id = ulliContent>Project management</li>
                    </ul>
                    These skills represent the three main aspects of the <b>holistic
                    education of a computer engineer</b>.

                    I expect to use the skils I acquire to make a positive impact on the world:
                    Aiming to resolve social or environmental problems which need a lot of thinking
                    to be solved. I would like to be involved in variuos sectors during my work years:

                    "<b>The demand for computer engineers in Spain has been steadily increasing, driven 
                    by the country's growing technology sector</b>. As digital transformation accelerates 
                    across industries, companies are actively seeking skilled computer engineers to innovate 
                    and maintain competitive edges. This surge in demand is not just limited to tech companies 
                    but extends to various sectors, including finance, healthcare, and retail, all integrating 
                    advanced technologies into their operations. <br><br>Furthermore, the rise of remote work has expanded 
                    opportunities, attracting international companies to tap into Spain's tech talent. This growing 
                    demand is also influencing educational institutions to adapt curricula, ensuring graduates meet the 
                    evolving requirements of the tech industry."
