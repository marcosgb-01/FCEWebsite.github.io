                    The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the phenomenon that 
                    permits objects to process information and connect in between 
                    themselves through the internet or other network. Devices collect 
                    information with sensors and other perception components and connect 
                    to other different devices with little to no human interaction.

                <h4 class = centered>Smart grids</h4>
                <div class = textSectionGlass>
                    Smart grids are a network of electricity that uses digital 
                    technologies like  advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), 
                    smart distribution management systems (SDMS), and smart grid 
                    communication networks among others to <b>monitor and manage the 
                    transportation of electricity from the generation sources to 
                    meet the needs of the users</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    The usage of smart grids varies from the supply of electricity 
                    to consumers using digital communications, and for the better optimization 
                    of this process the IoT capabilities are required. 
                    <br><br>
                    One of the many advantages 
                    that IoT brings to smart grids is the automatization of resource usage to 
                    minimize power and water consumption of businesses. All of this offers a 
                    new horizon in power generation, power delivery, reducing the number of cuts 
                    and decreasing the bill costs overall. It also has functionality when using it 
                    for deep-learning applications, as IoT brings vast amounts of data, this  helps 
                    to model and give information with the help of smart grids to sort out high 
                    demand responses in peak hour situations. 
                    <br><br>
                    With the IoT and deep learning 
                    implementations we could be able to predict and learn peak hours for high 
                    demands of electricity and thus making the processes much more responsive and 
                    efficient and make our electricity waste much lower and our efficiency much greater.

                <h4 class = centered>Block chains</h4>
                <div class = textSectionGlass>
                    Block chains are <b>decentralized distributed digital systems consisting of 
                    a chain of blocks that contain transactional data shared across a network 
                    of individuals that are connected to this network in an encrypted form</b>.
                    <br><br>  
                    Block chains play a big role regarding IoT ambient, especially when talking about 
                    security connections. This is made by a different store of data in 
                    chronological order that is inaccessible to adversaries. This impacts 
                    several industries like transportation, healthcare or manufacturing by 
                    helping to protect IoT systems from cyberattacks and increasing automation 
                    through the reduction of the necessity of intermediaries.

                Self-driving cars have been a big controversy over the years, 
                with high improvements being made constantly, the implementation of 
                IoT could mean the necessary technological advancement to send self-driving 
                cars to a complete reality. With more and more devices being interconnected 
                and sharing large amounts of data, more data traffic is being able to be 
                used to increment the accuracy and the level of trust we have in self-driving cars. 
                With all of this information self-driving cars' future is closer than ever before 
                although security and trustful data is still an emergent issue that needs to be 
                completely solved before being able to improve in this area.

                    While it may seem basic due to the reason for its creation, 
                    IoT makes tasks like cleaning a house easier and more efficient, 
                    <b>shifting activities that used to be performed entirely by 
                    humans to automated solutions</b>. This frees up time for humans to engage 
                    in other activities.

                    <div class = hseparatorhidden style = height:0></div>
                    The cornerstone of this concept is that physical objects can be connected 
                    to a network where they previously couldn't, providing access to all their 
                    capabilities. This facilitates real-time data transfer and communication 
                    between devices and people.

                    <div class = hseparatorhidden style = height:0></div>
                    The installation of these systems in certain contexts has helped <b>create a 
                    larger security network due to the quick response and predetermined actions in 
                    certain situations</b>. Being a real-time system, actions are much more efficient and 
                    faster than if a human were to perform them. For example, in a home surveillance system, 
                    you can set an alarm to sound when there is movement in the house or specific rooms when 
                    you leave home. These anti-theft alarms immediately alert the security company and the police, 
                    with the option to view camera footage if needed.

    <!--THE ETHICAL VIEW-->
    <h3 class = centered>The ethical view</h3>
    <div class = textSectionGlass>
        Even though IoT devices can help to make the users life easier, 
        more accessible and interconnected, it may have some negative issues 
        that must be considered in order to make the path of development of 
        these technologies more ethical overall.
        <br><br>
        The first issue that we might encounter when talking about this theme 
        is the inevitable fact that with the wearables we named before. 
        There exists the <b>risk of being tracked for everything you do</b>, 
        wherever you are doing with whoever you're doing it.
        <br><br>
        Another issue is connected with the term of <b>security</b>. Due to its small 
        operative system,wearables are more vulnerable than other devices, making 
        it quite more probable to be hacked and get your data breached putting yourself 
        in danger as well as your close friends and family. Ai is getting more advanced 
        being able to modify and create images and photos, this makes users vulnerable to 
        more easily made frauds. 
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, there exists a <b>digital breach, that with more advanced IoT 
        devices, might get bigger with the usage of these technologies, making it 
        impossible for some people to benefit from these devices</b>. 
        <br><br>
        Last but not least, making the amount of IoT devices we mentioned earlier 
        consumes a <b>massive amount of resources and creating more servers might cause 
        an impact on our ecosystem heavily</b>. So, not only we must care about our digital 
        impact but also for our carbon impact.
    </div>
    <h3 class = centered>Conclusion</h3>
    <div class = textSectionGlass>
        In our conclusion we must notice the advancements made by this technology over 
        the past few years, thanks to which we can have an easier day to day life. We 
        can also see that the disadvantages have a minor effect and thus are less important 
        than the advantages. As of right now the only main disadvantages for the wide variety 
        and uses of IoT could be separated between the cost and security issues, as they are 
        the main factors that will set this advancement back.
        <br><br>
        To conclude, we must point that our investigation in this topic makes one realize
        how much impact IoT has in our lives and how much potential of improvement and growth it 
        has in the near future. We believe that IoT will become one of the most important markets in 
        the next few decades.
